## Features



<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax etc.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>
<dt>Additional Features</dt>
<dd>Improved Generator, Cache for faster startup</dd>
  <dt>Static code analysis</dt>
  <dd>Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>
</dl>

But wait... there's more!

- _Native web app:_ Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
- _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/EvilSpark/react-redux-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
5.  Although I prefer using <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/">PNPM</a> instead of NPM.

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.
